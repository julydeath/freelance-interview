      answer:
        "For multinational implementations, we recommend a phased approach starting with a pilot in one region. Standardize core processes while allowing for regional variations in compliance requirements. Ensure you have local expertise in each region and strong global project governance. Data harmonization across regions is often the biggest challenge, so allocate sufficient resources to master data management.",

      question:
        "How can SAP TM reduce transportation costs and improve delivery times?",
      answer:
        "SAP TM reduces costs through optimized route planning, load consolidation, and carrier selection based on cost and performance. The system can identify opportunities to combine shipments, reducing the number of trips. Real-time visibility helps identify and address delays promptly, while predictive analytics help anticipate issues before they impact delivery times.",

        "What is the typical ROI timeframe for an SAP TM implementation?",
      answer:
        "Most organizations see a return on investment within 12-18 months after implementation. Initial benefits come from freight cost reduction (typically 8-15%) and administrative efficiency gains. Longer-term benefits include improved customer satisfaction from better delivery performance and strategic advantages from enhanced supply chain visibility.",
